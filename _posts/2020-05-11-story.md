title: "The story of WOWidget"

<p>
    I needed to regularly check critical business information (sales, system health).<br>
    I used Safari to access our dashboards, but that always seemed like too many clicks, especially in the morning.<br>
    I'm actively using iPhone widgets and wanted to see our information in a widget.<br>
    I couldn't find an app to achieve this, so I made one.<br>
    WOWidget was born.
