<p>
    Following the release of <a href="/2021-05-03-free">WOWidget as a free app</a>, downloads has skyrocketed.
</p>
<p>
    I announced the price on <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/wowidget/wowidget-is-now-free--MZgynETl2zNRhpA1oMi" target="_blank">Indie hackers</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27022770" target="_blank">Hacker news</a>.
</p>
<p>
    All of these new downloads resulted in a total of 1 review. Compared to historical data, it makes me think that all these downloads were artificial. I can't think of a valid reason why someone would do this, but the chart spike sure does look nice :)
