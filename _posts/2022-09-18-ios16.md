<p>
    WOWidget version 1.1.10 now runs on iOS 16. 
</p>

<p>
    Apple is slowly but surely deprecating Today (the original) widgets.
    Today, it is not possible to create or even debug the Today widget in the latest Xcode 14.
    Although Today widgets are still present in iOS 16, I strongly suspect that they will be removed in iOS 17 and that will sadly mean the end of WOWidget.
    Until then, enjoy the app for free!
