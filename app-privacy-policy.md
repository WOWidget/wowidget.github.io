<h1>WOWidget app privacy policy</h1>
<p>The app <u>does not</u> collect any user data.</p>

<h2>Crash reports</h2>
<p>If the app crashes while you're using it, anonymized data about the crash will be collected to help me identify the cause of the crash and hopefully fix it in a future update. These "crash logs" contain information such as the state of the app, operating system, and device at the time of the crash, but not your private data.</p>
<p>Crash reports <u>do not</u> include any user data such as URL.</p>

<p>This policy is effective as of 20 May 2020.</p>
