<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>

<h2>Is WOWidget secure?</h2>
<p>
    Yes.<br>
    The app <u>does not</u> collect any user data. Check out <a href="/app-privacy-policy">the app privacy policy</a>.<br>
    Use a <u>https://</u> connection wherever possible.
</p>

<h2>One click installation?</h2>
<p>
    Yes.<br>
    Every manager's dream come true.<br>
    Ask your <!-- overpriced --> developer to set up a widget and share it with you.
</p>

<h2>Can I share my widgets?</h2>
<p>
    Yes.<br>
    Tap on the share button inside the WOWidget app and share your widget with your friends and colleagues.
</p>

<h2 id="lock-screen">Lock screen?</h2>
<p>
    When viewing widgets on the lock screen, a small padlock is visible in the upper right corner. This means that some functionality is limited. iOS has a bug that prevents any website from loading on the lock screen. WOWidget regularly takes snapshots of active widgets and displays them as a fallback.
</p>

<h2>Apple watch?</h2>
<p>
    WatchOS does not allow developers to work with websites. The only solution would be to push snapshots from iPhone. Based on my testing, that is not reliable enough.
